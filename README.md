A brief description for each dataset (what is the task, what are the features and the target)
Dataset 1: ID: 1462 banknote-authentication
URL; https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&status=active&qualities.NumberOfClasses=%3D_2&id=1462
Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. A Wavelet Transform tool was used to extract features from these images. (Source: https://www.openml.org/d/1462).
Task: This dataset is about distinguishing genuine and forged banknotes. The task is to model the probability that a banknote is fraudulent as its features function. The number of instances (rows) in the data set is 1372, and the number of features (columns) is 5. 

Dataset 2: ID: 40983 (Wilt Data Set)
URL; https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&status=active&qualities.NumberOfClasses=%3D_2&id=40983
This data set involved detecting diseased trees in Quickbird satellite images. The high-resolution QuickBird images of 165 different area were acquired in 27 August 2012 to detect the diseased trees. The QuickBird images contains four 2.4 m resolution MS bands; G, R, NIR and PAN band. 
Task: The dataset is about the detection of Pine Wilt Disease (PWD) infected trees and non-affected. The number of instances (rows) in the data set is 4839, and the number of features (columns) is 6.
